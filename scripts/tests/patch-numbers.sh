# Each number in patches/engine/ names one patch (issue 15). The image applies the patches in filename order, so two
# files with one number still build, but their order then hangs on the words after the number, and "patch 0108" in a
# commit, the CHANGELOG or a log no longer names one file. Only numbered files are read: a NNNN-*.patch placeholder
# in a PR does not trip it.
